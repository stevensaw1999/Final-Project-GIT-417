        <h1>HTML and CSS Examples to Help You Get Started on the Final Project</h1>
        <p>These are just meant to help you when you begin the final project for GIT417. There is no JavaScript written, but if you struggle with HTML and CSS, these code examples are a start for the sections of the page you could use to build the product switcher, guessing game, or shopping cart. Be sure to update the code with appropriate content, ids and classes, and to write functional JavaScript to work with it for the final.Make sure that you understand how the styles are wokring and how the cascade is working here, as well as how CSS Reset works, because it was used in this pen, along with CSS variables and rem units.

    <!-- FROM THE REQUIREMENTS:
    Your coded site, to include semantic HTML, appropriate CSS (your site is not required to be responsive), and JS. ALL of the code written for this page must be written from scratch by you. Please see and review the academic integrity policy for more information. First, you'll have some required elements:
    The site will be a single page that displays properly styled at 1280 or 1440 pixels wide (fixed).
    The page should look like a real, stand-alone website. Users should see all of the kind of content that they would expect from any professional website. No placeholder text is allowed, text and photos should be realistic and high-quality, and everything you'd expect to see should be present (header, navigation (even within the page), footer, etc. -->
    
    <!-- This pen uses CSS Reset - If you would like to start with this HTML/CSS as a base in your project, you will need to use the CSS reset code as well or the styles won't work in the same way for you -->
